# All python scripts

This project will contain all Python scrips I create to improve my python skills

## **Automation**

This first folder includes function created specifically to improve daily coding, they will be populated with more function in coming weeks:
- Function to setup a new project folder structure with folders such as "data", "model", "output", "test" 
- Function to clean and save away your **downloads** folder, automate in a single function the classification and archiving of different file extensions "01 xlsx_files", "02 pdf_files", "03 shp_files", "04 csv_files", "05 ipynb_files", "06 Markdown_files" and "07 xls_files" for now.


# ML-using-Python
Machine Learning models using Python

This repository will include several univariate and multivariate TS models, and also some Neural Network model examples using Keras and Tensorflow. I will focus on neural network models that can be used in Time Series analysis.
