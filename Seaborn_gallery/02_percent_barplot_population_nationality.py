# This notebook will contain examples of stakced and percent barplots created using Seaborn. 
# Plots data used will be INE (Spanish National Institute) Spanish Office of National statistics
#  demographic time series indicators such as total population and population by nationality as 
# of 1st January and also by foreign population by country of birth.

# Load required libraries

# 1. Build path to project folder

# Get current working directory
my_wd = os.getcwd()
print("My working directory is:",my_wd)

# 1. List files in \data folder to identify Excel file to be imported into Python 
new_wd_ML_using_python = os.path.join("/home","pablo","Documents","Pablo_zorin","VS_Python_GitHub_Pablo_source","ML-using-Python")

# 2.change existing working directory to ML-using-Python folder to access Excel file located in \data folder
os.chdir(new_wd_ML_using_python)

new_wd = os.getcwd()
print("Changed working directory to:",new_wd)


# 2. Build path to Exel file to be imported from \data sub-folder

# - First we check the contents in our data folder to find Excel file to import into Python

# 2.1. Build path to Exel file to be imported from \data sub-folder

# 2.2 Build  path to Excel file location

# 3. Import Excel file into Python 
# Then we build path to Excel file we will load in Python using Pandas 
# Get individual tab names from previous "INE total and foreign population figures Spain.xlsx" file

# 4. Create new calculated fields 

# Get first dataframe column names and format data type info

# 4.1 New year column

# I can then modify this str[] parameter from str.strip() to slice four latest characters from Date column to obtain full year in YYYY format. I need to introduce [13:] 
# #to ensure I obtain a full year on my new Year variable

#  4.2 New Spanish nationals column derived from total and foreign population figures

# We will compute Spanish nationals column substracting Foreign population 
# # to Total population obtaining total population split by spanish/foreign nationality

# First we duplicate our original dataframe using .copy() function 
INE_population_nationality = INE_total_foreign_population.copy()
INE_population_nationality.head()

# Then we include our new Spanish nationals calculation from substracting Foreign_population to Total_population
INE_population_nationality['Spanish_nationals'] = INE_population_nationality['Total_population']- INE_population_nationality['Foreign_population']

# Also rename previous dataframe so new one is called "INE_spain_population" as it is 
# # just Spanish population split by nationality (Spanish nationals, foreign nationals)

INE_spain_population = INE_population_nationality.copy()
INE_spain_population.head() 

# Then I only need to subset required columns before I reshape the data 
INE_spain_population = INE_spain_population[['Year','Total_population','Spanish_nationals','Foreign_population']]

# 5. Reshape data for stacked percent barplot 
# We need to reshape previous dataframe so we have Spanish national and Foreign population under the same column
