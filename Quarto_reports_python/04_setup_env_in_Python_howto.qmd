# Creating new environments in Python using venv 

- This document describes how to create a Python environment using {venv} module. This environment is requierd to install required modules for any specific Python project

- For example, let's say I want to start a new project to design a Streamlit app in this location on my local machine: 

> /home/pablo/Documents/Pablo_ubuntu/Python_projects/05_Streamlit_app

- On my home machine, I have created a new folder called "05_Streamlit_app" where I want to design a new Steramlit app. 
- For reference, this is the main website for **Streamlit** apps module: <https://streamlit.io/>
